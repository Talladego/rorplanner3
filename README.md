## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd rorplanner3
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server

## Deploying to Cloudflare Pages

Cloudflare Pages is a fast, free static hosting platform with a global CDN. This project is preconfigured for it:
- Vite base: `/` (see `vite.config.ts`)
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`

Setup steps:

1. Push your repository to GitHub.
2. In Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages → Create a project → Connect to GitHub → select this repo.
4. Build command: `npm run build`
5. Output directory: `dist`
6. Save and deploy.

Custom domain: Add your domain in Pages → Custom domains and follow DNS prompts. SSL is automatic.

## Architecture


- Presentation (React components and hooks)
	- Location: `src/components`, `src/hooks`
	- Responsibilities: Render UI, handle user interactions, subscribe to domain events, and call Service methods.
	- Must not import the store or event emitter directly. Use `loadoutService` as the façade.
- Service (Domain orchestration, integration, events)
	- Responsibilities: Orchestrate domain operations, apply business rules (eligibility, unique-equipped, set bonuses, stat calc), fetch data via GraphQL, encode/decode URL state, and emit typed events.
	- Location: `src/services/loadout/*`
	- Submodules:
		- `queries.ts`: All GraphQL documents.
		- `api.ts`: Fetchers (items, talismans, details) with caching and prefetch.
		- `stats.ts`: Compute totals and per-stat contribution breakdowns.
		- `events.ts`: Subscribe to single/all event types.
		- `urlService.ts`: URL encode/decode, including renown ability levels in share links.
		- `urlSync.ts`: Guarded URL auto-update helper.
		- `renownConfig.ts`: Renown metadata and caps used by UI and stats.
	- Talks to Data via `loadoutStoreAdapter` (no React imports here) and emits events using `loadoutEventEmitter`.

- Data (State and pure data transforms)
	- Location: `src/store/loadout`
	- Responsibilities: Hold and mutate state using Zustand; expose a thin adapter `loadoutStoreAdapter` to decouple the store from the Service/Presentation layers.
	- Must not import from Service. The adapter is called by the Service; components must not call the store directly.

- Types and Events
	- Location: `src/types` and `src/types/events.ts`
	- Responsibilities: Centralize TypeScript enums, interfaces, and the typed event contracts the Service emits.

### Event-driven flow

1) A component invokes a Service method (e.g., `loadoutService.updateItem(...)`).
2) The Service updates state via the adapter (`loadoutStoreAdapter.setItem(...)`) and emits domain events (e.g., `ITEM_UPDATED`, `STATS_UPDATED`).
3) Components subscribe via `loadoutService.subscribeToEvents` or `subscribeToAllEvents` and re-render accordingly.

This keeps UI reactive without coupling components to the store internals.

### Key files

- `src/services/loadout/loadoutService.ts`: Main façade for domain ops and event emissions.
- `src/services/loadout/loadoutEventEmitter.ts`: Minimal pub/sub used internally by the Service.
- `src/services/loadout/queries.ts`: Centralized GraphQL documents.
- `src/services/loadout/api.ts`: Data fetchers for items/talismans/item details.
- `src/services/loadout/cache.ts`: LRU list cache and icon pre-warm.
- `src/services/loadout/stats.ts`: Stats aggregation and contribution logic.
- `src/services/loadout/events.ts`: Event subscription helpers for components.
- `src/services/loadout/urlService.ts`: URL encode/decode for dual-compare, including renown; feature flags for auto-update and navigation parsing.
- `src/services/loadout/urlSync.ts`: Guarded URL auto-update helper.
- `src/services/loadout/renownConfig.ts`: Renown ability metadata used by UI and stats.
- `src/constants/statMaps.ts`: Mapping between GraphQL stat enums and summary keys.
- `src/store/loadout/loadoutStore.ts`: Zustand store composition.
- `src/store/loadout/loadoutStoreAdapter.ts`: Adapter the Service uses to read/write store state.
- `src/lib/apollo-client.ts`: Apollo client setup for GraphQL.

### Boundary rules (do/don't)

- Components:
	- Do call `loadoutService` methods and subscribe with `loadoutService.subscribeToEvents`.
	- Don’t import `useLoadoutStore` or `loadoutEventEmitter` directly.

- Service:
	- Do call `loadoutStoreAdapter` for state reads/writes and emit typed events.
	- Don’t import React or hooks; don’t render UI.

- Store:
	- Do keep state and pure transformations (no network, no URL, no business orchestration).
	- Don’t import Service; no cyclic deps.

### Typical interaction example

- Selecting an item in the UI:
	- `EquipmentSelector` → `loadoutService.getItemWithDetails(id)` → `services/loadout/api.getItemWithDetailsApi` via the façade (LRU/in-flight dedupe wrapper).
	- `loadoutService.updateItem(slot, item)` → `loadoutStoreAdapter.setItem(...)` → emit `ITEM_UPDATED` → recompute → emit `STATS_UPDATED`.
	- `StatsComparePanel` listens via Service subscription helpers to update its view.

### Contributor checklist to preserve boundaries

## Housekeeping

- Prefer `src/services/loadout/queries.ts` as the single source for GraphQL documents. Avoid scattering `gql` outside this module unless strictly scoped to a local API call.

- URL feature flags (in `urlService`):
	- `setAutoUpdateEnabled(boolean)`: Enable/disable mutation of the URL in response to state changes.
	- `setNavigationHandlingEnabled(boolean)`: Enable/disable parsing the URL on navigation changes after initial load.
	- `setNavigateCallback(fn)`: Injected from React Router to perform updates.

- Share links include renown ability levels: `a.renown.<ability>=<level>` and `b.renown.<ability>=<level>`. These are applied when loading from the URL.

- When adding a feature:
	- Put domain logic in the Service (and its submodules).
	- Keep the Store focused on state shape and pure calculations only.
	- Subscribe to changes via Service; never from components to the store directly.
	- Emit/handle typed events defined in `src/types/events.ts`.
